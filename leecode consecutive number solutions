###leetcode consecutive numbers question


solution one by joins
seletc distinct (L1.num) as consecutive_numbers from logs L1
left join logs L2 on L1.id=L2.id+1
left join logs L3 on L1.id=L3.id+2
where L1.num=L2.num and L2.num=L3.num


second solution by lag and lead

with cte as (
select num,
lag(num)over(order by id) as previous_num
lead(num)over(order by id) as next_num
lag(num)over(order by id) as previous_num2
lead(num)over(order by id) as next_num2
from logs
)
select num from cte
where (num=previous_num and num=next_num)
or (num=previous_num and num=previous_num2)
or (num=next_num and num=next_num2)
order by num;
